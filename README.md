# DreamPC
A SQL database-centric web application

There are numerous models of personal computers in the market, and sometimes it is difficult to choose one from them,
especially when the choice costs thousands of dollars. Our application, DreamPC, is a great helper. 
For people who know a lot about computer configuration, there are options related to CPU cores(single, dual, quad), 
RAM size(8GB,16GB,24GB), system(linux, OSX, windows), and users can choose their desired configuration to fit their needs. 
Some people do not know much about what each configuration does, but they appreciate the appearance of Apple products, 
or they need a tablet instead of a laptop in order to draw pictures, or they need Windows to play video games, 
so we include questions regarding brand, model type, etc. 
Our application then searches for the computer models according to the attributes given by user preference, 
and outputs a list of models for the user. If the user still cannot decide, DreamPC will randomly choose one from the list.
